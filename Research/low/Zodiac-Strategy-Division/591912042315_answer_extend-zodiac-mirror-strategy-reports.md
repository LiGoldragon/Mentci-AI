# Agent Report

- Date: `2026-02-22`
- Kind: `answer`
- Change Scope: `modified-files`
- Subject: `Zodiac-Strategy-Division`
- Title: `Extend Zodiac Category Strategy to Strategy-Report Mirror`

## Prompt

extend zodiac-category strategy for strategy to reports - the two mirror each other and when one category of strategy is consulted, it will be useful to consult corresponding category in the other side of the equation (strategy/report)

## Agent Answer

Extended the zodiac strategy so `Development/` and `Research/` are explicitly mirrored by category and subject.

Changes made:
1. `Development/Zodiac-Strategy-Division/Strategy.md`
- Upgraded scope from strategy-only to bilateral strategy/report mirror.
- Replaced optional report-zodiac note with mandatory mirror invariant.
- Expanded migration plan to move both trees and update tooling.
- Added enforceable consult-both workflow rule.
- Expanded acceptance criteria to include report category completeness and no-orphan mirror checks.

2. `Development/Zodiac-Strategy-Division/SYMBOLIC_CORRESPONDENCE_SPEC.md`
- Added bilateral mirror rule section.
- Added consultation contract requiring both sides to be checked during category lookup.

Net effect:
- Zodiac category lookup now encodes a two-sided discovery discipline: strategy intent + report evidence.

## Reporting Protocol Notes

- This report is required for `answer`, `draft`, and `question` responses.
- Reporting still applies when response scope is `no-files`.
