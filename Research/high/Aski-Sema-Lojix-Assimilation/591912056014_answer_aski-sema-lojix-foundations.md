## 1. Intent
Incorporate raw notes from `Sources/TheBookOfGoldragon/Raw_Notes/59191205-Transcription-Sema_Lojix_Aski.md` as a high-authority source for project evolution.

## 2. Key Architectural Concepts

### 2.1 Aski (A-S-K-I)
*   **Role:** Text-native optimization for LLM cognition.
*   **Syntax:** Inspired by Clojure/EDN, translates to Rust implementation.
*   **Significance:** Misunderstood by agents; requires better guidelines. It recognizes keywords as objects.

### 2.2 SEMA (Binary Format)
*   **Role:** Fully specified computer format (non-text).
*   **Structure:** Huge structured trees of enumerators and vectors.
*   **Precursor:** Formerly called `Sajban` ("language of knowledge").
*   **Efficiency:** Two to three orders of magnitude more efficient than text for LLMs.

### 2.3 Logics (`lojix`)
*   **Role:** Rust-based specification for rendering structured data into text.
*   **Dialect:** Fork of Clojure with an extended EDN (EDN Next/v2).
*   **Advantage:** Lisp-like genius; no reliance on newlines/whitespace, saving context space.

### 2.4 Agentic Flow & Actors
*   **Actor-Based Programming:** Declared "king" for agentic environments.
*   **Ownership:** Single owner concept (inspired by Rust and Erlang) to prevent data racing and double ownership.

### 2.5 Mentci Box and Isolation
*   **Principal Mentci Box:** Restricted by OS contract (NixOS module); sources are read-only.
*   **Impeccability:** Taking into account natural law and avoiding damage; renaming is cheap with fully spec'd Aski.

## 3. Implementation Directive
Pull all previous specifications into `Sources/` and index them. Jujutsu is the mandatory interface for Git interaction.

## 4. Authority Alignment
This data is marked as **High Weight**. It represents the "True North" for the system's evolution toward Level 6 instinctive interaction.
