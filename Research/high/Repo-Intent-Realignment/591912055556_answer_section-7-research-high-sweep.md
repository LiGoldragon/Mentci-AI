# Research Artifact: Section 7 - Research High-Priority Sweep

- **Solar:** ♓︎ 5° 55' 56" | 5919 AM
- **Subject:** `Repo-Intent-Realignment`
- **Title:** `section-7-research-high-sweep`
- **Status:** `finalized`

## 1. Intent
Clean up the `Research/high/` section of the repository by removing obsolete artifacts, stale links, and redundant `README.md` files while ensuring all topics are correctly indexed.

## 2. Findings
*   **Redundant READMEs:** All subdirectories in `Research/high/` contained `README.md` files that were largely redundant with the canonical `index.edn` files. Many were also stale and lacked recent report entries.
*   **Path Drift:** No active `Reports/` or `Strategies/` path drift was found in this section; existing references were either historical or correctly updated to `Research/` and `Development/`.
*   **Structure Consistency:** `Research/high/` topics were found to be correctly mirrored with `Development/high/` subjects.

## 3. Actions Taken
*   **Cleanup:**
    - Removed all `README.md` files in `Research/high/*/`.
    - Verified all `index.edn` files in `Research/high/` subdirectories.
*   **Validation:**
    - Confirmed `Research/` and `Development/` cross-references.
    - Verified no broken links to `Reports/` or `Strategies/` in active research artifacts.

## 4. Section Status: Cleaned
1. No active `README.md` files in `Research/high/` subdirectories.
2. All topic indices reflect current artifact locations.
3. No live `Reports/` or `Strategies/` drift.
