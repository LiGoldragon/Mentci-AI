## Prompt

development to go through the project section by section to remove dead links, abandonned ideas and obsolete artifacts

## Agent Answer

Created an executable Development program for section-by-section cleanup.

Changes:
1. Added detailed sweep program:
- `Development/high/Repo-Intent-Realignment/SECTION_SWEEP_PROGRAM.md`
- Includes section order, per-section procedure, classification model (`retain/integrate/archive/remove`), validation gates, and done criteria.

2. Extended roadmap with execution phase:
- `Development/high/Repo-Intent-Realignment/Roadmap.md`
- Added `Phase 5: Section Sweep Program` to make the cleanup loop part of the canonical roadmap.

Outcome:
- The repo now has an explicit operational plan to systematically remove dead links, abandoned ideas, and obsolete artifacts section-by-section with checkpointed research output.
