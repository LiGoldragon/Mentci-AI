- Kind: `answer`
- Change Scope: `modified-files`
- Subject: `Strategy-Development`
- Title: `persist-context-to-restart-strategies-reports`

## Prompt

save as much of your current context to the filesystem in Library/RESTART_CONTEXT.md (which should be auto-loaded from Core/) and in strategies and reports


## Agent Answer

Persisted current operational context into `Library/RESTART_CONTEXT.md` with updated programming version, live bookmark heads, recent session commit map, guard status, extension-index mechanism, and open-risk checklist. Updated strategy context and process in `Development/Strategy-Development/STRATEGY.md`. Repaired report topic indexes for both `Research/Strategy-Development/index.edn` and `Research/Debugging/index.edn` so existing report artifacts are indexed and discoverable.


## Reporting Protocol Notes

- This report is required for `answer`, `draft`, and `question` responses.
- Reporting still applies when response scope is `no-files`.
