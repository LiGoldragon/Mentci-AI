# Research Artifact: STT Context Decoding Priority Escalation

- **Solar:** ♓︎ 5° 59' 47" | 5919 AM
- **Subject:** `STT-Context-Decoding`
- **Title:** `stt-priority-escalation`
- **Status:** `finalized`

## 1. Intent
Elevate the `STT-Context-Decoding` subject from `low` to `high` priority to reflect its critical role in extracting guidance from large audio-note transcriptions (e.g., `TheBookOfGoldragon`).

## 2. Findings
*   The author has explicitly marked STT context research as high priority.
*   The ability to accurately decode and assimilate long audio notes is a prerequisite for Level 5/6 evolution.

## 3. Actions Taken
*   Moved `Research/low/STT-Context-Decoding` to `Research/high/STT-Context-Decoding`.
*   Moved `Development/low/STT-Context-Decoding` to `Development/high/STT-Context-Decoding`.
*   Updated `index.edn` and `Report.md` to reflect the new tier.
*   Synchronized R&D mirror.

## 4. Next Steps
*   Initiate analysis of the first large audio-note from `Sources/bookofgoldragon`.
*   Refine the Whisper-based context injection pipeline.
