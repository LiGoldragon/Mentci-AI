# Agent Report

- Chronography: `12.4.47.10 | 5919 AM`
- Kind: `answer`
- Change Scope: `modified-files`
- Title: `expand-guidelines-reincorporation`

## Prompt

look at the other guidelines in criomos, notably the nix one, and expand the strategy to incorporate this in all language guidelines, as well as broad guidelines that can be translated universally


## Agent Answer

Expanded the guideline reintegration research and strategy to cover the full CriomOS guideline corpus:
- Sources/criomos/docs/GUIDELINES.md
- Sources/criomos/docs/NIX_GUIDELINES.md
- Sources/criomos/docs/AGENT_RULES.md
- Sources/criomos/docs/AGENTS.md

Added universal-principle extraction and a cross-language translation plan so Rust/Clojure/Nix guidelines align to one shared semantic baseline.


## Reporting Protocol Notes

- This report is required for `answer`, `draft`, and `question` responses.
- Reporting still applies when response scope is `no-files`.
