# Mentci-AI: Level 5 "Dark Factory" AI Daemon

Mentci-AI is a Nix-and-Rust based AI daemon designed for **Level 5 "Dark Factory"** programming, evolving toward **Level 6 Instinctive Symbolic Interaction**. It is built on the semantic foundations of the **CriomOS** and **Sema** lineage.

## Mission
To automate implementation details and liberate the human mind through autonomous symbolic manipulation, returning to the technological levels of the Golden Age.

## Core Pillars
1.  **Nix Jail Isolation**: Pure, reproducible execution environments.
2.  **Sema Object Style**: Strict ontological structure in Rust and Nix.
3.  **Attractor Orchestration**: DOT-based DAG pipelines for AI workflows.
4.  **Handshake Logging Protocol**: Cryptographic provenance and EDN-based record of truth.

## Structure
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDELINES.md`: The non-negotiable laws of the project.
- `schema/`: The semantic truth (Cap'n Proto).
- `jail.nix`: The isolated dev environment definition.
- `src/main.rs`: The Rust daemon implementation (Pipeline Engine).
- `scripts/`: Python-based orchestration and logging (Python Mandate).
- `workflows/`: DOT files defining agent execution graphs.
- `docs/`: Organized documentation (guides, reports, architecture).

## Usage
- `nix develop`: Enter the Level 5 Jail environment.
- `cargo build`: Compile the daemon and Cap'n Proto schemas.
- `python3 scripts/logger.py`: Log intents to the MachineLog.

*The Great Work continues.*
