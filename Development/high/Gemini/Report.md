# Report: Gemini

## Summary
Created a unified Gemini subject pair to centralize research persistence and reduce drift across fragmented Gemini topics.

## Outcomes
- Added `Research/high/Gemini/index.edn`.
- Added first consolidated research entry for Google Antigravity behavior in `pi` and upstream Gemini CLI context.
- Added implementation strategy/report counterparts under `Development/high/Gemini`.

## Follow-Up
- Append future Gemini Q/A research notes into this subject and update cross-links as new subtopics emerge.
