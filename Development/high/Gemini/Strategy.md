# Strategy: Gemini

## Objective
Maintain a single agglomeration subject for Gemini-related research and implementation guidance, with explicit coverage of provider/auth/endpoint behavior and model availability risks.

## Scope
- Consolidate findings from Gemini-related subjects into one durable reference path.
- Track distinctions across `google`, `google-gemini-cli`, and `google-antigravity` lanes.
- Record stability/security implications and recommended usage lanes for production vs experimental flows.

## Initial Plan
1. Aggregate existing Gemini research references into `Research/high/Gemini`.
2. Record authoritative source-backed findings with code/doc pointers.
3. Keep this subject updated when future Gemini questions are answered.
