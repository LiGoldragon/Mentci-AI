# Expansion Subaspect: Wisdom Manifestation Program

## Objective
Propose an expanded, implementation-ready version of the initial CriomOS guideline wisdom that is:
- aligned to `Goal 0` stabilization
- translatable across all Mentci language guidelines
- integrated with existing strategy system dependencies

## Goal Alignment
### Goal 0: mentci-aid Stabilization
This expansion treats guideline wisdom as operational infrastructure for stability:
1. Reduces semantic drift across Rust/Clojure/Nix behavior.
2. Improves deterministic architecture decisions under agent execution.
3. Increases auditability by making universal principles explicit and testable.

## Expansion Model
### Layer A: Universal Canon (One-Truth Principle Set)
Create one canonical principle set (in universal guideline anchor) with mandatory translations:
1. Naming Is a Semantic Layer.
2. Objects Exist; Flows Occur.
3. Domain-Protocol Rule.
4. Direction Encodes Action.
5. Construction Resolves to Receiver/Definer.
6. Single Object In/Out boundary contract.
7. Schema Is Sema; encoding is incidental.
8. Filesystem as semantic and durability layer.
9. Documentation protocol and clarity obligations.

### Layer B: Language Realization Packs
Each language guideline must map every universal principle to language-native constructs.

Rust realization pack:
- `impl`/trait domain enforcement.
- Constructor placement on receiver type.
- Anti-composite-role naming constraints.

Clojure realization pack:
- `defprotocol` + `extend-type` as method-domain equivalent.
- Namespace/object vs flow separation rules.
- Lite schema declaration macros that preserve canonical Malli semantics.
- Input-first signature compression with explicit/deterministic output typing.

Nix realization pack:
- Attrset namespace grouping rules.
- Construction at defining attrset/module boundary.
- Existing `lib` domain reuse mandates.
- Filesystem semantic boundary examples for module topology.

### Layer C: Enforcement and Drift Control
1. Guideline consistency checker:
- verify required section headers
- verify universal-to-language translation coverage
- flag missing/contradictory principle mappings

2. Regression guardrails:
- wire checks into script validation and sweep reporting
- generate delta reports when guidelines diverge from universal canon

## Strategy Coupling Matrix (Inspiration + Dependency)
1. `strategy-development`
- Use tool-discovery loop to evaluate lightweight guideline-check tooling.

2. `artifact-sweep`
- Remove redundant or contradictory guideline fragments outside canonical locations.

3. `project-hardening`
- Add contract tests for guideline structure and translation completeness.

4. `debugging`
- Add “principle mapping failure” as a first-class debug category.

5. `agent-authority-alignment`
- Ensure all guideline references resolve to canonical `Core/` paths.

6. `malli-verbosity-reduction`
- Apply expanded Clojure method and lite-schema principles without weakening typing.

7. `session-aggregation-guard` + reporting system
- Require session-level provenance + `Research/` artifacts for guideline updates.

## Implementation Tracks
### Track 1: Canon Restoration
- Restore missing wisdom depth from CriomOS universal and Nix sources.

### Track 2: Clojure Semantic Parity
- Introduce method-domain and lite-schema guidance to mirror Rust/Nix rigor.

### Track 3: Validation Infrastructure
- Build/ship checker scripts and add CI/local validation hooks.

### Track 4: Governance
- Maintain mapping table and change protocol for all future guideline edits.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Every universal principle has explicit Rust/Clojure/Nix realization text.
2. Clojure guideline includes protocol-method and lite-schema constraints with strong output typing guarantees.
3. Nix guideline regains lost depth from CriomOS Nix source.
4. Checker detects mapping gaps and section omissions.
5. Guideline changes always produce session + report provenance.

*The Great Work continues.*
