# Development

Development subjects are tiered by importance:

- `Development/high/<Subject>/`
- `Development/medium/<Subject>/`
- `Development/low/<Subject>/`

## R&D Mirror Note
- R&D in this repository is the paired model: `Development/` + `Research/`.
- Every development subject must mirror a same-name research topic at `Research/<priority>/<Subject>/index.edn`.
- `Development/` captures executable plans and implementation guidance; `Research/` captures prompt-answer traceability and findings.

Canonical subject-to-tier mapping:
- `Development/high/Repo-Intent-Realignment/PriorityTriage.md`
