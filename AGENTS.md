# Mentci-AI Agent Entry Rules

> **Canonical Aski framing:** Aski is a text-native optimization for LLM cognition; Mentci uses Aski lightly while moving toward visual/symbolic interfaces; everything is structured data (homoiconicity). Authority: `docs/architecture/ASKI_POSITIONING.md`.

Canonical agent policy lives in:

* `docs/architecture/AGENTS.md`

All repository agent behavior must follow that file.
