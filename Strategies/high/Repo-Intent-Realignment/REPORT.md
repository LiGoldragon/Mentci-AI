# Strategy Report: Repo Intent Realignment

## Status
Drafted.

## Current Output
1. Intent-realignment strategy created from prompt-history failure modes and Core authority constraints.
2. Cleanup model defined (`retain/integrate/archive/remove`) to prevent ad hoc deletion.
3. Four-phase roadmap defined for controlled artifact reduction and contract lock-in.

## Next Action
Produce an inventory artifact mapping concrete files/scripts to the four cleanup buckets and execute the first high-severity slice (`Sources` cutover in active paths).
