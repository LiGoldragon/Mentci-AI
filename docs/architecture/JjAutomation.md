> **Canonical Aski framing:** Aski is a text-native optimization for LLM cognition; Mentci uses Aski lightly while moving toward visual/symbolic interfaces; everything is structured data (homoiconicity). Authority: `docs/architecture/ASKI_POSITIONING.md`.

This document is superseded by `docs/architecture/VERSION_CONTROL.md`, which is the primary reference for JJ workflows.
