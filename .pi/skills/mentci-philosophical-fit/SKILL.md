# Skill: Mentci Philosophical Fit

Use this skill to ensure all technical implementations align with the author's intent as the "Pattern Anchor" for the psyche.

## When to use
- Before finalizing a plan.
- When choosing between implementation abstractions.
- When an agent feels "disconnected" from the core philosophy.

## Instructions
1. **Silence as Fit:** If a solution is not yet clear, or the question hasn't been fully formulated by the psyche, do not suggest code. Propose a clarifying question instead.
2. **Logic-Data Separation:** Verify that no hardcoded configuration is entering the Rust logic.
3. **Symbolic Accuracy:** Ensure timestamps use Chronos (Solar Time) and identifiers avoid repeating enclosing context.
4. **Impeccability:** Act without attachment to the "fruits" (the final diff). Focus on the "skill in action"—the quality of the transition.

## Success Criteria
- The author confirms the "arrangement" feels correct.
- Code is sparse, symbols are dense (Aski style).
