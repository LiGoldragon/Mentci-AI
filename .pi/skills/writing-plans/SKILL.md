## Repo-Local Nix Purity Rule
- Treat every repository as a self-contained world during Nix evaluation.
- Never reference files from a parent repo, sibling checkout, ad-hoc absolute path, or undeclared local path escape inside Nix code.
- If reusable Nix code is needed, it must live inside the active repository or arrive through a declared flake input; if we create that code, it belongs in a repository and our repository workflow remains Git-backed JJ.
- Deep modules must not `../`-escape repo boundaries to find package code. Root-wire shared derivations from the active repo root and pass them down through module arguments / `specialArgs`.


# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** Prefer an isolated independent `jj` clone for larger work. A dedicated worktree is acceptable for smaller, low-risk tasks.

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Boundaries
- Read code and docs: yes
- Write to docs/plans/: yes
- Edit or create any other files: no

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Execute this plan using either `/skill:executing-plans` (parallel session) or `/skill:subagent-driven-development` (same-session loop).

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**TDD scenario:** [New feature — full TDD cycle | Modifying tested code — run existing tests first | Trivial change — use judgment]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Finalize via `jj-agent`**

Ask the `jj-agent` agent to:
- establish bounded JJ state,
- finalize the current intent into the correct described revision,
- push the runtime target bookmark,
- verify local/remote bookmark alignment.
Use `jj-expert` only if the `jj-agent` lane is unavailable or misbehaving.

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
- Order tasks so each task's dependencies are completed by earlier tasks
- If plan exceeds ~8 tasks, consider splitting into phases with a checkpoint between them

## Mandatory Phase Loop
Before advancing, ensure this loop is closed for every task:
1. Brainstorm
2. Plan
3. Implement
4. Test
5. Review
6. Re-implement with Review

**Stop Conditions:**
- Never advance with missing evidence.
- Never advance with unresolved review issues.
- If loop is broken, revert to previous state and re-initialize.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, mark the planning phase complete: call `plan_tracker` with `{action: "update", status: "complete"}` for the current phase.

Then offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - Fresh subagent per task with two-stage review. Better for plans with many independent tasks.

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Batch execution with human review checkpoints. Better when tasks are tightly coupled or you want more control between batches.

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `/skill:subagent-driven-development`
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
- Guide them to open a new isolated session (prefer independent `jj` clone; worktree acceptable for smaller scopes)
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses `/skill:executing-plans`
