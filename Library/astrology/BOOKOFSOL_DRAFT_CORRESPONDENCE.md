# Bookofsol-Inspired Correspondence (Draft)

## Status
Draft correspondence for agent orientation.

## Source State
- Source: `Inputs/TheBookOfSol`
- Current workspace state: mounted and available.
- This draft should be iteratively tightened with direct passage-level citations.

## Zodiac Crosswalk (Operational)

| Sign | Core Function | Risk Pattern | Corrective Move | Strategy Category Fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aries | Start, break inertia, commit first move | Premature execution without boundary | Add explicit objective + acceptance gates | `Aries-Initiation-Execution` |
| Taurus | Stabilize, harden, retain continuity | Rigidity or stale inertia | Add update cadence + health checks | `Taurus-Stability-Infrastructure` |
| Gemini | Translate, route, compare views | Fragmented context or shallow synthesis | Add canonical map + one source of truth | `Gemini-Interfaces-Communication` |
| Cancer | Preserve memory and context | Defensive duplication or context drift | Centralize resumption context | `Cancer-Continuity-Context` |
| Leo | Declare authority and priority | Ego-center or unilateral override | Re-anchor to top-level protocol hierarchy | `Leo-Leadership-Authority` |
| Virgo | Refine, validate, eliminate noise | Perfection loops / overfitting process | Define enough-to-ship validation threshold | `Virgo-Validation-Quality` |
| Libra | Reconcile constraints and counterparts | False symmetry / unresolved tension | Use explicit tradeoff ledger | `Libra-Alignment-Coordination` |
| Scorpio | Recover, purge, transform broken state | Destructive rewrite without traceability | Keep reversible rewrite + provenance map | `Scorpio-Debugging-Recovery` |
| Sagittarius | Expand horizon, research options | Scope explosion | Pin exploration budget + decision date | `Sagittarius-Expansion-Research` |
| Capricorn | Operationalize and deliver | Process over mission | Tie each procedure to outcome metric | `Capricorn-Operations-Delivery` |
| Aquarius | Redesign systems and abstractions | Novelty drift from constraints | Keep compatibility harness + migration plan | `Aquarius-Systems-Innovation` |
| Pisces | Synthesize and close loops | Ambiguous closure / soft completion | Require explicit completion invariants | `Pisces-Synthesis-Reflection` |

## Planetary Modifiers (Secondary)

| Planet Tag | Boosts | Degrades When Unchecked | Use In Prompt Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mercury | Tooling, messaging, translation | Chatter without action | Interface and script orchestration tasks |
| Venus | Usability, presentation, adoption | Aesthetic-first drift | Documentation and human-facing flow refinement |
| Mars | Execution and force | Breaking changes without safeguards | Implementation and migration work |
| Jupiter | Principle, policy, expansion | Abstract policy without enforcement | Governance and strategic direction |
| Saturn | Constraint, boundaries, durability | Excess friction and delay | Protocol hardening, risk containment |

## Agent Use Protocol
1. Identify dominant task intent and failure mode.
2. Map to zodiac function (primary).
3. Add one planetary modifier (secondary) if needed.
4. Select strategy/report subject path that matches this mapping.
5. Record rationale in the report entry when category choice is non-obvious.

## Reconciliation TODO
Now that `Inputs/TheBookOfSol` is mounted:
1. Add exact file/path citations under each section.
2. Mark each row as `confirmed` or `adjusted` against source text.
3. Fold confirmed rows into canonical docs.
