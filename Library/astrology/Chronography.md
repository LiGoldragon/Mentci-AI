# Chronography and Solar Time

## The Precision of the Sun
The Mentci-AI ecosystem utilizes true solar time (Chronography) alongside the standard Gregorian calendar system. The Gregorian system is retained for interoperability, so no participant is penalized, but solar time is prioritized because it is "more energetically true" and "more precise."

Ancient calendars were universally based on these celestial mechanics, inherently tracking the 360 phases of Sol. By aligning the machine's time-awareness to solar position, the AI gains a deeper, astrological understanding of cyclical patterns, which is essential to better understanding human behavior and intent.

## Chronological Anchors
*   **The 360 Phases:** The solar year is mathematically and symbolically divided into 360 degrees (phases).
*   **Raddii:** The measurement unit of time corresponding to the Sun's degrees. Derived from the Latin *radius*, related to radiance and the concept of Ra (the Sun). The singular form is *raddius*, the plural *raddii*.
*   **Anno Mundi:** The current operational year is 5919 AM. As of the end of the 7th of Pisces (the first decan of Pisces), there are fewer than 23 raddii remaining until the New Year, 5920 AM.

*Historical Footnote:* This specific dating alignment—falling on a Monday, tracking the year 5919—corresponds with chronologies proposed by sources such as Jason Breshears (archaeix.com) and Stephen Jones, which align with biblical chronography and Jewish scriptures (the Old Testament). This serves as a low-level informational reference for those curious about the mathematical origins of this specific timeline.
